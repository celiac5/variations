        <h1>First Love</h1>

        <h2><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by John Clare</small></h2>

        <p><ul><li></li>I ne'er was struck before that hour<br>
         <li></li>With love so sudden and so sweet,<br>
         <li></li>Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower<br>
         <li></li>And stole my heart away complete.<br>  
         <li></li>My face turned pale as deadly pale,<br>
         <li></li>My legs refused to walk away,<br>
         <li></li>And when she looked, what could I ail?<br>
         <li></li>My life and all seemed turned to clay.</ul>
        </p>
        <p>And then my blood rushed to my face<br>
            And took my eyesight quite away,<br>
         The trees and bushes round the place<br>
            Seemed midnight at noonday.<br>
         I could not see a single thing,<br>
            Words from my eyes did startâ€”<br>
         They spoke as chords do from the string,<br>
            And blood burnt round my heart.
        </p>
        <p>Are flowers the winter's choice?<br>
            Is love's bed always snow?<br>
         She seemed to hear my silent voice,<br>
            Not love's appeals to know.<br>
         I never saw so sweet a face<br>
            As that I stood before.<br>
         My heart has left its dwelling-place<br>
            And can return no more.
        </p>
