        <h1>First Love</h1>

        <h3><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by John Clare</small></h3>

        <p><li>I ne'er was struck before that hour</li><br>
         With love so sudden and so sweet,<br>
         <li>Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower</li><br>
         And stole my heart away complete.<br>  
         <li>My face turned pale as deadly pale,</li><br>
         My legs refused to walk away,<br>
         <li>And when she looked, what could I ail?</li><br>
         My life and all seemed turned to clay.
        </p>
        <p><ul><li>And then my blood rushed to my face</li><br>
            And took my eyesight quite away,<br>
         <li>The trees and bushes round the place</li><br>
            Seemed midnight at noonday.<br>
         <li>I could not see a single thing,</li><br>
            Words from my eyes did startâ€”<br>
         <li>They spoke as chords do from the string,</li><br>
            And blood burnt round my heart.</p>ul>
        </p>
        <p><li>Are flowers the winter's choice?</li><br>
            Is love's bed always snow?<br>
         <li>She seemed to hear my silent voice,</li><br>
            Not love's appeals to know.<br>
         <li>I never saw so sweet a face</li><br>
            As that I stood before.</li><br>
         <li>My heart has left its dwelling-place</li><br>
            And can return no more.
        </p>
