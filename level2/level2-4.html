        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><small>by John Clare</small></em></h3>

        <p><ul><li>I ne'er was struck before that hour</li><br>
          <li>With love so sudden and so sweet,</li><br>
         <li>Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower</li><br>
          <li>And stole my heart away complete.</li><br>  
         <li>My face turned pale as deadly pale,</li><br>
          <li>My legs refused to walk away,</li><br>
         <li>And when she looked, what could I ail?</li><br>
          <li>My life and all seemed turned to clay.</li></ul>
         <br>
        </p>
        
        <p>And then my blood rushed to my face<br>
         <br>
            And took my eyesight quite away,<br>
            <br>
         The trees and bushes round the place<br>
         <br>
            Seemed midnight at noonday.<br>
            <br>
         I could not see a single thing,<br>
         <br>
            Words from my eyes did startâ€”<br>
            <br>
         They spoke as chords do from the string,<br>
         <br>
            And blood burnt round my heart.</p>
            <br>
        </p>
        
        <p><ul><li>Are flowers the winter's choice?</li><br>
            <li>Is love's bed always snow?</li><br>
         <li>She seemed to hear my silent voice,</li><br>
           <li> Not love's appeals to know.</li><br>
         <li>I never saw so sweet a face</li><br>
            <li>As that I stood before.</li><br>
         <li>My heart has left its dwelling-place</li><br>
            <li>And can return no more.</li></ul>
        </p>
