        <h1>First <em>Love</em></h1>

        <h3>by John Clare</h3>

        <p>I ne'er was struck before that <em>hour</em><br>
            With <strong>love</strong> so sudden and so sweet,<br>
         Her <em>face</em> it bloomed like a sweet flower<br>
            And stole my heart away <em>complete</em>.<br>  
         My face turned pale as <em>deadly</em> pale,<br>
            My legs refused to walk <em>away</em>,<br>
         And when she <em>looked</em>, what could I ail?<br>
            My <em>life</em> and all seemed turned to clay.
        </p>
        <p>And then my <em>blood</em> rushed to my <em>face</em><br>
            And took my <em>eyesight</em> quite away,<br>
         The <em>trees</em> and <em>bushes</em> round the place<br>
            Seemed <em>midnight</em> at noonday.<br>
         I could not see a <em>single</em> thing,<br>
            Words from my eyes did <em>start</em>â€”<br>
         They spoke as <em>chords</em> do from the <em>string</em>,<br>
            And <em>blood</em> burnt round my <em>heart</em>.
        </p>
        <p>Are flowers the <em>winter's</em> choice?<br>
            Is <strong>love's</strong> bed always snow?<br>
         She seemed to hear my <em>silent</em> voice,<br>
            Not <strong>love's</strong> appeals to know.<br>
         I never saw so <em>sweet</em> a face<br>
            As that I stood <em>before</em>.<br>
         My heart has left its <em>dwelling-place</em><br>
            And can return <em>no more</em>.
        </p>
