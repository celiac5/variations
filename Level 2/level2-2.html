        <h1>First Love</h1>

        <h2>by <em>John Clare</em></h2>

        <p>I ne'er was struck before that <strong>hour</strong><br>
            With love so sudden and so <em>sweet</em>,<br>
         Her face it bloomed like a sweet <strong>flower</strong><br>
            And stole my heart away <em>complete</em>.<br>  
         My face turned pale as deadly <strong>pale</strong>,<br>
            My legs refused to walk <em>away</em>,<br>
         And when she looked, what could I <strong>ail</strong>?<br>
            My life and all seemed turned to <em>clay</em>.
        </p>
        <p>And then my blood rushed to my <strong>face</strong><br>
            And took my eyesight quite <em>away</em>,<br>
         The trees and bushes round the <strong>place</strong><br>
            Seemed midnight at <em>noonday</em>.<br>
         I could not see a single <strong>thing</strong>,<br>
            Words from my eyes did <em>start</em>â€”<br>
         They spoke as chords do from the <strong>string</strong>,<br>
            And blood burnt round my <em>heart</em>.
        </p>
        <p>Are flowers the winter's <strong>choice</strong>?<br>
            Is love's bed always <em>snow</em>?<br>
         She seemed to hear my silent <strong>voice</strong>,<br>
            Not love's appeals to <em>know</em>.<br>
         I never saw so sweet a <strong>face</strong><br>
            As that I stood <em>before</em>.<br>
         My heart has left its dwelling-<strong>place</strong><br>
            And can return no <em>more</em>.
        </p>
