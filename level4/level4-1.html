      <span class="firstpara1">
         I ne'er was struck before that <span class="hour">&nbsp;hour</span><br>
         With <span class="love1">&nbsp;love</span> so sudden and so sweet,<br>
        Her <span class="face1"><em>&nbsp;face</em></span> it bloomed like a sweet flower<br>
         And stole my heart away <span class="complete">&nbsp;complete</span>.<br>
        My face turned pale as <span class="deadly"><em>&nbsp;deadly</em></span> pale,<br>
         My legs refused to walk <span class="away">&nbsp;away</span>,<br>
        And when she <span class="looked">&nbsp;looked</span>, what could I ail?<br>
         My <span class="life">&nbsp;life</span> and all seemed turned to <span class="life">&nbsp;clay.</span>
      </span>

      <span class="secondpara1">
         And then my <span class="blood1">&nbsp;blood</span> rushed to my <span class="blood1">&nbsp;face</span><br>
         And took my <span class="eyesight">&nbsp;eyesight</span> quite away,<br>
        The <span class="trees">&nbsp;trees</span> and <span class="trees">&nbsp;bushes</span> round the place<br>
         Seemed <span class="midnight">&nbsp;midnight;</span> at <span class="midnight">&nbsp;noonday</span>.<br>
        I could not see a <span class="single">&nbsp;single</span> thing,<br>
         Words from my eyes did <span class="start">&nbsp;start</span>â€”<br>
        They spoke as <span class="chords"><em>&nbsp;chords</em></span> do from the <span class="chords"><em>&nbsp;string</em></span>,<br>
         And <span class="blood2">&nbsp;blood</span> burnt round my <span class="blood2">&nbsp;heart</span>.
      </span>

      <span class="thirdpara1">
         Are flowers the <span class="winter">&nbsp;winter</span>'s choice?<br>
         Is <span class="love2">&nbsp;love</span>'s bed always <span class="love2">snow</span>?<br>
        She seemed to hear my <span class="silent">&nbsp;silent</span> voice,<br>
         Not <span class="love3">&nbsp;love</span>'s appeals to know.<br>
        I never saw so <span class="sweet">&nbsp;sweet</span> a face<br>
         As that I stood <span class="before">&nbsp;before</span>.<br>
        My heart has left its <span class="dwelling"><em>&nbsp;dwelling-place</em></span><br>
         And can return <span class="nomore">&nbsp;no more</span>.
      </span>
