        <span class="subheading3"><h3>by John Clare</h3></span>

        <div class="firstpara3">
         <span class="s1">I ne'er was struck before that hour<br></span>
         <span class="s2">With love so sudden and so sweet,<br></span>
         <span class="s3">Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower<br></span>
         <span class="s4">And stole my heart away complete.<br></span>  
         <span class="s5">My face turned pale as deadly pale,<br></span>
         <span class="s6">My legs refused to walk away,<br></span>
         <span class="s7">And when she looked, what could I ail?<br></span>
         <span class="s8">My life and all seemed turned to clay.</span>
         <br>
        </div>

        <div class="secondpara3">
           <br>
           <br>
         <span class="s9">And then my blood rushed to my face<br></span>
         <span class="s10">And took my eyesight quite away,<br></span>
         <span class="s11">The trees and bushes round the place<br></span>
         <span class="s12">Seemed midnight at noonday.<br></span>
         <span class="s13">I could not see a single thing,<br></span>
         <span class="s14">Words from my eyes did startâ€”<br></span>
         <span class="s15">They spoke as chords do from the string,<br></span>
         <span class="s16">And blood burnt round my heart.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="thirdpara3">
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <span class="s17">Are flowers the winter's choice?<br></span>
         <span class="s18">Is love's bed always snow?<br></span>
         <span class="s19">She seemed to hear my silent voice,<br></span>
         <span class="s20">Not love's appeals to know.<br></span>
         <span class="s21">I never saw so sweet a face<br></span>
         <span class="s22">As that I stood before.<br></span>
         <span class="s23">My heart has left its dwelling-place<br></span>
         <span class="s24">And can return no more.</span>
